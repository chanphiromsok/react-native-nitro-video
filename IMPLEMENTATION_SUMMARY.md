# Video Player Implementation - Final Summary

## Architecture Overview

Successfully implemented a **separated player-view architecture** following the pattern used by `react-native-video`.

### Key Components

1. **Threading Utility** (`utils/Threading.kt`)
   - Thread-safe execution helpers
   - `runOnMainThread()` - Async main thread execution
   - `runOnMainThreadSync()` - Sync main thread execution with result

2. **HybridVideoPlayer** (`core/HybridVideoPlayer.kt`)
   - Independent ExoPlayer instance
   - Thread-safe player controls
   - View attachment/detachment methods
   - WeakReference to current view (prevents memory leaks)

3. **HybridVideoView** (`react/HybridVideoView.kt`)
   - PlayerView container
   - Handles player prop changes
   - Auto-detaches old player when new one is set

## Implementation Pattern

### Player Attachment Flow

```kotlin
// In HybridVideoPlayer
fun attachToView(newView: PlayerView) {
  Threading.runOnMainThread {
    // ExoPlayer's built-in method for safe view switching
    PlayerView.switchTargetView(player, currentPlayerView?.get(), newView)
    currentPlayerView = WeakReference(newView)
  }
}
```

### View Player Setter

```kotlin
// In HybridVideoView
override var player: HybridVideoPlayerSpec? = null
  set(value) {
    // 1. Detach old player
    val oldPlayer = field
    if (oldPlayer is HybridVideoPlayer) {
      oldPlayer.detachFromView()
    }
    
    field = value
    
    // 2. Attach new player
    if (value is HybridVideoPlayer) {
      value.attachToView(playerView)
    }
  }
```

## Thread Safety

All ExoPlayer operations run on the main thread:
- ✅ `attachToView()` / `detachFromView()`
- ✅ `play()` / `pause()` / `stop()`
- ✅ `replaceVideoSource()`
- ✅ Media source loading

## Usage Example

```tsx
// Create player once with initial URI
const player = createNitroPlayer('https://example.com/video1.mp4');

// Display in view
<VideoView player={player} style={styles.video} />

// Change video (reuses same player)
player.replaceVideoSource({ uri: 'https://example.com/video2.mp4' });
player.play();

// Control playback
player.play();
player.pause();
player.stop();

// Cleanup
player.release();
```

## Benefits

1. **Reusable Player** - Same player instance can be used across multiple views
2. **Thread-Safe** - All operations properly synchronized to main thread
3. **Memory Efficient** - WeakReference prevents memory leaks
4. **Smooth Transitions** - `switchTargetView` handles view switching seamlessly
5. **Industry Pattern** - Follows battle-tested approach from react-native-video

## Key Files Modified

- ✅ `android/src/main/java/com/margelo/nitro/nitrovideo/utils/Threading.kt` (new)
- ✅ `android/src/main/java/com/margelo/nitro/nitrovideo/core/HybridVideoPlayer.kt`
- ✅ `android/src/main/java/com/margelo/nitro/nitrovideo/react/HybridVideoView.kt`
- ✅ `android/src/main/java/com/margelo/nitro/nitrovideo/NitroVideo.kt`

## Testing

Run the example app:
```bash
yarn example android
```

Check logs:
```bash
adb logcat | grep -E "HybridVideoPlayer|HybridVideoView"
```

Expected logs:
```
HybridVideoPlayer: Media source set with URI: https://...
HybridVideoPlayer: Player attached to view with URI: https://...
HybridVideoPlayer: play()
```

## Status

✅ **COMPLETE** - Video player is now properly separated from the view with thread-safe operations.
